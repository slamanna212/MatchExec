## ❔ What is MatchExec
MatchExec handles all aspects of managing video game matches. Do you want to host tournaments, organize game nights, or prove you're better than the other team? MatchExec is for you! 

Inspired by a Discord server I am a part of, I wanted to improve the process of private video game matches. They take a lot of time to setup, coordinate, and orchestrate. MatchExec handles all of that so you can focus on playing, and winning.

Create a Match, and MatchExec handles the rest!
